            There are many reasons to start a blog for personal use and only a handful of strong ones for business blogging. Blogging for business, projects, or anything else that might bring you money has a very straightforward purpose – to rank your website higher in Google SERPs, a.k.a. increase your visibility. As a business, you rely on consumers to keep buying your products and services. As a new business, you rely on blogging to help you get to potential consumers and grab their attention. Without blogging, your website would remain invisible, whereas running a blog makes you searchable and competitive

            Obama’s personal charisma, stirring oratory, and his campaign promise to bring change to the established political system resonated with many Democrats, especially young and minority voters. On January 3, 2008, Obama won a surprise victory in the first major nominating contest, the Iowa caucus, over Sen. Hillary Clinton, who was the overwhelming favourite to win the nomination. Five days later, however, Obama finished second to Clinton in the New Hampshire primary, and a bruising—and sometimes bitter—primary race ensued. Obama won more than a dozen states—including Illinois, his home state, and Missouri, a traditional political bellwether—on Super Tuesday, February 5.

            The Joker’s long history of being misinterpreted as a heroic figure, rather than a terrorist, has only added fuel to the debate over whether Joker’s particularly violent version of the character is worthy of the screen—especially given that director Todd Phillips tried to ground the movie in a reality that mirrors our own, rather than some artificial comic-book universe. The discussion around Joker centers on whether the movie scrutinizes or empathizes with its protagonist, whose acts of violence are born at least in part from feelings of rejection by women in his life.

            The Dark Knight has always put the brunt of his war on crime squarely upon his own shoulders. Even considering the sheer number of allies he's acquired over the years, Batman is often driven to the point of exhaustion in his mission to protect the people of Gotham City and the world at large. But there's at least one new hero who believes Batman operates differently thanks to the sheer number of partner's he's had.

            Graduating from school, getting married, watching your grandkids take their first steps. Turns out, your life truly flashes before your eyes before you die – at least that’s according to new research on near-death experiences. In a moving study, Israeli scientists shed light on what happens moments before you die by interviewing people who nearly did. From intimate conversations, they learned that flashbacks don’t happen in chronological order like what’s conventionally thought. The doctors behind the study out of Hadassah University in Jerusalem suggest that these memories replay in your final breaths because the part of the brain that stores memories may be the last to go

            Big ideas can change the world, can’t they? Surely enhanced knowledge of how things work can help us to resolve the urgent problems of today. And isn’t it true that the application of our know-how is at the heart of societal progress?

We would all like to think that these statements are true. They are the reason why in 2007 we came up with the idea of launching this magazine — Our World.

We started with the aim of looking at just three problems and their interconnections — climate change, peak oil and food security (adding biodiversity loss after the launch of the magazine) — and we asked ourselves how we could effect change on a wide scale. By “we”, we meant the United Nations University.

The answer seemed obvious. Thanks to the Internet more people now are connected than at any other time in history. Roughly 2.8 billion people have access to the web, which represents 38% of the total world population.
